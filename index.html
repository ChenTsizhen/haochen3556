        <h2>Nice to meet you. I'm Hao Chen.</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a rising junior at Cornell University studying Information Science and minoring in Game Design.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I'm assisting research at Smart Computer Interfaces for Future Interactions (Sci-Fi) Lab.
            Before that, I worked as a Business & Design subteam member at Cornell Mars Rover and directed videos for my high school.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside school, I'm learning to develop 2D games and make YouTube videos. 
            In my free time, you can find me doing choreography, riding a skateboard, reading detective novels, or learning the piano.

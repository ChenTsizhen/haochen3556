        <h2>Nice to meet you. I'm Hao Chen.</h2>
        <p>
            Thank you so much for reading through my story.
            This page is part of my secret journey.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm not a hardcore science student, honestly. I didn't know a single line of code until university.
            Instead, I come from an (sort of) artistic family. Mom was an amateur vocalist, and she taught me singing.
        </p>

        <p>
            My first "job" was a junior dancer. I was lucky enough to skip class and had good times on the stage.
            Meanwhile, I took up science olympaid to catch up school work, which is a wise decision of my parents.
        </p>

        <p>
            But the solo life makes it hard to socialize with peers, so I paused my dance career at middle school.
            Mom and dad just want me to have friendship, as a normal kid deserves.
        </p>

        <p>
           In high school, I discovered iMovie on my laptop. I enjoyed exploring the software while producing visual arts.
           My passion for dance finally comes back to me, in a form of technology.
